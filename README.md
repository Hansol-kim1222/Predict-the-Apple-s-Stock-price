It is crucial to provide a very accurate forecast of a potential pattern in a financially unpredictable environment, such as the stock market. It is imperative to provide a secure estimate of the prices of stocks following the financial crisis and the scoring of earnings. Predicting a non-linear signal requires sophisticated machine learning models. This report includes analyses of some machine learning algorithms with diverse collections of functions. 
Predicting the stock can be very complicated as it is influenced by a lot of factors that are contributing to economic growth. These factors along with a highly volatile nature of the stock prices makes it difficult to predict the future prices of stock. But, by using advanced algorithms stock prediction is getting less complex and can be done effectively. 
The theory of machine learning forecasting is to find insights by training an approximation of the representation of extracted features. Then the trained model algorithm is used for predicting potential values. This paper presents the use of machine learning as a forecasting process to predict the stock market price.
